MySqlConnector Docs
===================

Documentation from the `content` directory is built using the static site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)

To preview documentation changes locally, [Install Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases), then run `hugo serve` from this directory

All documentation pushed to the `master` branch will automatically be built and posted to https://mysql-net.github.io/MySqlConnector/
