# Async MySQL Connector for .NET and .NET Core

This is an [ADO.NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e80y5yhx.aspx) data
provider for [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). It provides implementations of
`DbConnection`, `DbCommand`, `DbDataReader`, `DbTransaction`â€”the classes
needed to query and update databases from managed code.

Complete documentation is available at the [MySqlConnector Documentation Website](https://mysql-net.github.io/MySqlConnector/).

## Why Use This Library?

### Async Support

This library implements true asynchronous I/O for database operations, without blocking
(or using `Task.Run` to run synchronous methods on a background thread). This greatly
improves the throughput of a web server that performs database operations.

### Performance

This library outperforms Connector/NET (`MySql.Data`) on benchmarks:

(Client: MySqlConnector 0.44.0, Windows 10 x64; Server: MySQL Server 5.6.21, Unix)

### Bug Fixes

This library [fixes dozens of outstanding bugs](https://mysql-net.github.io/MySqlConnector/tutorials/migrating-from-connector-net/#bugs-present-in-connector-net-that-are-fixed-in-mysqlconnector) in Connector/NET.

## Building

Install the latest [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

To build and run the tests, clone the repo and execute:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet test tests\MySqlConnector.Tests
```

To run the side-by-side tests, see [the instructions](tests/README.md).

## Goals

The goals of this project are:

1. **.NET Standard support:** It must run on the full .NET Framework and all platforms supported by .NET Core.
2. **Async:** All operations must be truly asynchronous whenever possible.
3. **High performance:** Avoid unnecessary allocations and copies when reading data.
4. **Lightweight:** Only the core of ADO.NET is implemented, not EF or Designer types.
5. **Managed:** Managed code only, no native code.
6. **Independent:** This is a clean-room reimplementation of the [MySQL Protocol](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/client-server-protocol.html), not based on Connector/NET.

Cloning the full API of Connector/NET is not a goal of this project, although
it will try not to be gratuitously incompatible. For common scenarios, this package should
be a drop-in replacement.
